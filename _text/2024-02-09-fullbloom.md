title: "The Moment in Full Bloom"
author: Nawoo Kim
date: 2023-08-01
excerpt: Humans contemplate and perceive through corporeal experiences. When sensing objects, Nawoo Kim at times projects her bodily experiences as a woman. Specifically, she envisioned the womb in the concave formation of a shell cradling its flesh, and human reproductive organs in the elongated pistils and stamens of blossoms. From these images, Nawoo Kim sensed a powerful vitality and energy radiating despite their inherent fragility. Drawing from these perceptions, she materializes pulsating life force in her works by either anthropomorphizing seashells and flowers or rendering them in forms that transcend reality.

Humans contemplate and perceive through corporeal experiences. When sensing objects, Nawoo Kim at times projects her bodily experiences as a woman. Specifically, she envisioned the womb in the concave formation of a shell cradling its flesh, and human reproductive organs in the elongated pistils and stamens of blossoms. From these images, Nawoo Kim sensed a powerful vitality and energy radiating despite their inherent fragility. Drawing from these perceptions, she materializes pulsating life force in her works by either anthropomorphizing seashells and flowers or rendering them in forms that transcend reality.

Shells and flowers, the central motifs in Nawoo Kim's paintings, exist as vulnerable entities consumed by humanity, offering pleasure both gastronomically and aesthetically. Yet each maintains autonomous existence and, through intervals of endurance, shells occasionally manifest pearls, while flowers shed their petals to engender fruit. Though delicate and ephemeral, they persevere toward the precious subsequent phase. One might suggest that Nawoo Kim projects significance onto shells and flowers parallel to the suffering a mother endures during childbirth. Beings that might appear infinitely vulnerable and finite sustain the unbroken sequence of existence. She perceived them as resilient because, akin to humanity, shells and flowers also withstand suffering to generate novelty, thereby perpetuating the cycle of life. Nawoo Kim's canvases capture the moment when such fragile entities ultimately flourish through suffering and fortitude. The shells and flowers within her pictorial realm construct a surreal domain where blossoming vitality endures eternally as illusory imagery. Nawoo Kim imbues her paintings with the aspiration that the depicted subjects might eternally blossom within the artistic realm.
