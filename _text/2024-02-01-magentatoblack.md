title: "In Magenta, In Black: The Life of Vividness"
author: Yuki Konno
date: 2024-02-01
excerpt: Walking by with a single bloom—humans, time, memories in passage. Life may not be brightness where darkness occasionally crosses and gradually dims, but perhaps something closer to emitting or losing different clarities according to subtle shifts in saturation. As we journey through life, certain things catch our eye more than others, but what stands before us is neither shadowed nor consumed by darkness. While brightness—this lightness and darkness—splits into positive and negative, saturation resists such division. Perhaps life's present state and its conclusion also exist side by side like saturation's highs and lows. The vividly visible and the barely perceptible in daily existence, connected without division, create ebbs and flows here—in our lives, with subtle vibrations.

Walking by with a single bloom—humans, time, memories in passage. Life may not be brightness where darkness occasionally crosses and gradually dims, but perhaps something closer to emitting or losing different clarities according to subtle shifts in saturation. As we journey through life, certain things catch our eye more than others, but what stands before us is neither shadowed nor consumed by darkness. While brightness—this lightness and darkness—splits into positive and negative, saturation resists such division. Perhaps life's present state and its conclusion also exist side by side like saturation's highs and lows. The vividly visible and the barely perceptible in daily existence, connected without division, create ebbs and flows here—in our lives, with subtle vibrations.

The dual exhibition by Nawoo Kim and Flâneur bears the title "Magenta to Black." This title alone suggests a singular direction: from a striking, eye-catching hue gradually declining toward a quiet, contemplative tone. In his paintings, magenta and black predominantly form flowers and shells, with some canvases embracing both colors simultaneously. The chromatic contrast reveals not deterioration in one direction but movement in its broadest sense. Within these works, movement becomes a path that horizontally and cyclically traverses between clarity and its absence, reality and unreality, ultimately between life and death. When explaining one's work as "twisting reality," this stance differs from dismissing or distorting reality. The very gesture of "twisting" serves as a sensory bridge that loosely connects reality with unreality.

In Kim's paintings, magenta and black, flowers and shells dance between decorative patterns and tangible forms. Within this painted realm, Flâneur's floral/botanical creations similarly bridge reality and unreality. Flowers represent familiar elements we encounter and observe daily as decorations, yet in the exhibition space, Flâneur's work cultivates an atmosphere both comforting and strangely unfamiliar. Together with Kim's paintings, Flâneur's botanical works sketch a boundary landscape through reality-twisting, and this landscape emerging from twisted reality can also connect the illusory past and future moments with present reality. Flowers and shells inherently carry symbolic weight. Just as flowers embody "celebration," they manifest connecting specific messages with their intended recipients. Yet symbolism doesn't merely bind objects to meanings—it harbors emotions transmitted across time. When we invest flowers with wishes or mourning, those sentiments flow from the present toward near or distant futures.

If we find ourselves drawn to floral vividness, it's because the vitality directed toward past and future dwells within that brilliance, alongside emotions and symbolic meanings. If flowers reveal vividness's vitality, shells disclose the vitality of distance. Even when only the shell remains, even when unopened, life's breath resonates within. What echoes in a seashell gathered from shoreline sands is the undulation—waves from distant pasts surging into our present moment. It represents vitality channeled through absence, more precisely, vitality beyond the invisible. The silence embedded in the shell not only nurtures inner vitality but encompasses the distant past, life's very origins. Life unfolds as we oscillate between vividness and its absence—tranquility—while hearing ocean symphonies from solid ground.

To illustrate life means simultaneously illustrating its absence—death. The etymology of magenta reveals how the 1859 Battle of Magenta coincides with this color's discovery. Victory born in desolation, found at the precipice of life and death, infuses this color. Magenta and black embody colors where life and death flow together across battlegrounds. Black and white doesn't signify vanished existence but invites contemplation of what lies beyond, allowing quiet passage of time. In such silence, we surrender not breath but heart—only to return transformed into vividness. Unreality, and the breath of past and future, visible and audible in flowers and shells, flows into our reality. Coming from magenta to dwell in magenta, coming from black to remain in black, subtly pulsing between these states (from/on)—this is life itself.
